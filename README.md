## Project Overview

This project involves using MySQL to clean and standardize data in a layoffs dataset. Key processes include **Data Modeling**, **Data Exploration**, **Data Cleaning**, and **Data Standardization**. The goal is to create a clean, standardized dataset that is free of duplicates, inconsistencies, and null values to enable accurate analysis of layoffs data.

## 1. Data Modeling

### Database and Table Creation

- **Database**: Created a dedicated database called `world_layoffs`.
- **Data Archiving**: Backed up the original dataset to ensure data preservation before any transformations.
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE world_layoffs;

  CREATE TABLE layoffs_copy LIKE layoffs;

  INSERT INTO layoffs_copy
  SELECT *
  FROM layoffs;
  ```

---

## 2. Data Exploration

### Basic Data Insights

1. **Preview Random Samples**: Selected 10 random rows to understand the data layout.
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM layoffs_copy
    ORDER BY RAND()
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
2. **Row Count**: Verified the total number of rows.
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_num
    FROM layoffs_copy;
    ```
3. **Duplicate Check**: Used a window function to identify duplicate rows based on key fields.
    ```sql
    WITH duplicate AS (
        SELECT *,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                   PARTITION BY `company`, `location`, `industry`, `total_laid_off`,
                   `percentage_laid_off`, `date`, `stage`, `country`, `funds_raised_millions`
               ) AS dub_row_num
        FROM layoffs_copy
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM duplicate
    WHERE dub_row_num > 1;
    ```

## 3. Data Cleaning

### Duplicate Removal and Column Adjustments

1. **Duplicate Removal**: Created a clean table without duplicates.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE layoffs_clean AS
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
               PARTITION BY `company`, `location`, `industry`, `total_laid_off`,
               `percentage_laid_off`, `date`, `stage`, `country`, `funds_raised_millions`
           ) AS dub_row_num
    FROM layoffs_copy;
    ```
2. **Duplicate Deletion**: Deleted rows with duplicate identifiers.
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM layoffs_clean
    WHERE dub_row_num > 1;
    ```
3. **Column Adjustment**: Removed the helper column `dub_row_num` after duplicate handling.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE layoffs_clean
    DROP COLUMN dub_row_num;
    ```

## 4. Data Standardization

### Data Consistency and Null Handling

1. **Whitespace and Naming Consistency**: Trimmed spaces from company names and standardized `Crypto` industry values.
    ```sql
    UPDATE layoffs_clean
    SET company = TRIM(company);

    UPDATE layoffs_clean
    SET industry = 'Crypto'
    WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');
    ```
2. **Country Name Correction**: Standardized country names for consistency.
    ```sql
    UPDATE layoffs_clean
    SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country)
    WHERE country LIKE 'United States%';
    ```
3. **Date Format Conversion**: Converted date values to a consistent format.
    ```sql
    UPDATE layoffs_clean
    SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');
    ALTER TABLE layoffs_clean
    MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;
    ```
4. **Null Handling**: Addressed null values in `industry`, `total_laid_off`, and `percentage_laid_off`.
    ```sql
    UPDATE layoffs_clean
    SET industry = NULL
    WHERE industry = '';

    DELETE FROM layoffs_clean
    WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
      AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;
    ```
